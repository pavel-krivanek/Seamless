"
I am special Tost substitution format which use Seamless network transfer strategies to prepare transfer objects which should be written on stream. 

By default it is objects themselfs. And in such cases I pass given object further to other transporter formats and not write them on stream.

In other cases it could be SeamlessObjectReference which I will write on stream instead of original objects. It is the way how transfer by reference strategy is executed
